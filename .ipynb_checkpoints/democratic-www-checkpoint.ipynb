    "### About the Speaker\n",
    "Benjamin D. Fedoruk is a data scientist, currently studying mathematics and computer science at Ontario Tech University. He has completed various data science works, including research into carbon pricing efficacy, public transit systems in northern/rural communities, and most majorly, has conducted research to reduce the spread of misinformation on social media. He is interested in NLP, and data science at-large. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Overview\n",
    "The Internet is filled with a vast array of information -- some is true, some is false. But, is there a programmatic method to effectively determine the verity of information, without the need for human intervention? This is where the Plebeian Algorithm shines, which you will learn about in this workshop. You will learn how to implement a Plebeian-esque algorithm into your personal projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Audience\n",
    "This workshop is for you if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- you have an introductory level of data science skills in Python.\n",
    "- you are interested in natural language processing.\n",
    "- you want to learn applications of data science skills to real-world problems.\n",
    "- you want to find solutions to the spread of misinformation. \n",
    "- you are intrigued by problem solving approaches using data science. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics Covered\n",
    "Topics covered in this workshop include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plebeian algorithms\n",
